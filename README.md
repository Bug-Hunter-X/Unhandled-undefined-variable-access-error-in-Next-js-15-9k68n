# Unhandled undefined variable access error in Next.js 15

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when transitioning to Next.js 15, specifically concerning accessing properties of undefined variables.  This issue, previously masked or handled differently in previous versions, can now throw runtime errors.

## Problem Description:

In Next.js 15, attempting to access a property (e.g., using `.toString()`) of an undefined variable will cause an error, halting execution and potentially breaking the application.  This is a critical departure from past behaviors, demanding stricter error handling.

## Solution:

The solution involves robust null checks to ensure variables are defined before property access. This can be achieved using optional chaining (?.) or other conditional checks.

## How to Reproduce:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to the `/about` route.
5. Observe the error in the browser's console.
